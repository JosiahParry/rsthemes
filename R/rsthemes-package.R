#' @description
#' This package provides a set of complete RStudio themes that restyle the
#' IDE and the editor syntax. The themes are built from
#' [sass](https://sass-lang.org) templates into `.rstheme` files that,
#' ultimately, contain the CSS files that provide the themes. The sass templates
#' provide an easy-to-extend framework for customizing the look of RStudio. If
#' you would like to create your own theme, [rstheme()] is designed to help you
#' get started quickly.
#'

#'     \pkg{rsthemes}? Read more in [rsthemes-actions].
